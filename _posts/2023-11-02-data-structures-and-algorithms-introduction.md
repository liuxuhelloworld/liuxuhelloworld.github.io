The term *algorithm* is used in computer science to describe a finite, deterministic, and effective problem-solving method suitable for implementation as a computer program.

Algorithms and data structures go hand in hand.

The primary reason to learn about algorithms is that this discipline gives us the potential to reap huge savings, even to the point of enabling us to do tasks that would otherwise be impossible.
