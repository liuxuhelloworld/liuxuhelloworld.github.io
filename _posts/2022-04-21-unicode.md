Before Unicode, there were many different character encoding schemes. This caused two problems. First, a particular code value corresponds to different letters in the different encoding schemes. Second, the encodings for languages with large character sets have variable length: some common characters are encoded as single byte, others require two or more bytes. Unicode was invented to overcome the limitations of traditional character encoding schemes.

A **code point** is a code value that is associated with a character in an encoding scheme. In the Unicode standard, code points are written in hexadecimal and prefixed with U+, such as U+0041 for the code point of the Latin letter A.

Unicode has code points that are grouped into 17 **code planes**. The first code plane, called the **basic multilingual plane**, consists of the Unicode characters with code points U+0000 to U+FFFF. Sixteen additional planes, with code points U+10000 to U+10FFFF, hold the **supplementary characters**.

The UTF-16 encoding represents all Unicode code points in a variable-length code. The characters in the basic multilingual plane are represented as 16-bit values, called **code units**. The supplementary characters are encoded as consecutive pairs of code units. Each of the values in such an encoding pair falls into a range of 2048 unused values of the basic multilingual plane, called the **surrogate area** (U+D800 to U+DBFF for the first code unit, U+DC00 to U+DFFF for the second code unit).
