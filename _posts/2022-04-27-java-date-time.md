The standard Java library contains two separate classes: the **Date** class, which represents a point in time, and the **LocalDate** class, which expresses days in the familiar calendar notation. The Library designers decided to separate the concerns of keeping time and attaching names to points in time. Separating time measurement from calendars is good object-oriented design. In general, it is a good idea to use different classes to express different concepts.
