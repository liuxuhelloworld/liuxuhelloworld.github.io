In the Java API, an object from which we can read a sequence of bytes is called an *input stream*. An object to which we can write a sequence of bytes is called an *output stream*. These sources and destinations of byte sequences can be, and often are, files, but they can also be network connections and even blocks of memory. The abstract classes **InputStream** and **OutputStream** are the basis for a hierarchy of input/output classes.

Byte-oriented input/output streams are inconvenient for processing information stored in Unicode. Therefore, a separate hierarchy provides classes, inheriting from the abstract **Reader** and **Writer** classes, for processing Unicode characters. These classes have read and write operations that are based on **char** values (that is, UTF-16 code units) rather than **byte** values.
